## Overview

`bm` is a utility for opening bookmarks and queries from the command line.

It allows you to quickly open bookmarks and perform search queries in your
browser using only your keyboard.

## CLI

### Requirements

`bm` is designed to work on any operating system, but it has only been tested
on Linux.

### Installation

#### Installation From Source

`bm` can be built from source using [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org).
For example, you can install the latest release (to `/usr/local` on Linux) as
follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ExtremaIS/bm-haskell.git
$ cd bm-haskell
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

##### `.deb` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

##### `.rpm` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

[Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/bm-haskell/releases>

### Usage

Bookmarks and search queries are configured using a hierarchy of keywords in a
YAML configuration file.  They are selected using keyword prefixes as
command-line arguments.  Command-line completion is available for Bash.  See
the [`bm` man page](doc/bm.1.md) for details.

Note that the command used to open bookmarks and queries can be customized in
the configuration file.  Specifying the command for your specific browser can
make links open considerably faster than with the default (generic) command.

#### Examples

An example configuration file is available in the `config` directory on
GitHub (example for the latest release: [bm.yaml][]).  The following are
example commands using this configuration file.

Open a bookmark link by specifying keywords.  The Nix homepage can be opened
with the following command:

```
$ bm nix
```

The `nixpkgs` manual can be opened using the following command:

```
$ bm nix pkgs manual
```

Keyword prefixes can also be used.  The following command also opens the
`nixpkgs` manual:

```
$ bm n p m
```

When more than one keyword has the same prefix, the first is selected.  If a
selected bookmark does not specify a URL, the first child is processed.

The `/` keyword defines a bookmark with a URL as well as a query.  When no
query is specified, the URL is opened, allowing you to search with suggestions
using the search field.  Open a query by specifying keywords followed by the
query.

```
$ bm / LinearTypes
```

When multiple query arguments are provided, they are joined with a space.
